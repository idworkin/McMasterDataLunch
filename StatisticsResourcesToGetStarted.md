# Statistics resources to get started.

This is based on a discussion led by Susan Marsh-Rollo (Nov 23rd 2018) about how to get ready for taking a class like Bio708, or just get yourself started with learning statistics from a few different perspectives. Not meant to be comprehensive, just suggestions from discussions.


## Primary resources

### A good pairing (R skills but fundamentals).
A Primer of Ecological Statistics
	NJ Gotelli & AE Ellison
- focused on introducing the basic conceptual side, experimental design, inference. Platform agnostic. Very clear. Not a heavy focus on effect size and inferences about them (too bad).

 [Introductory Statistics with R](http://www.academia.dk/BiologiskAntropologi/Epidemiologi/PDF/Introductory_Statistics_with_R__2nd_ed.pdf)
	Peter Dalgaard
- this represents the Rish practical side and the mechanics of analysis and inference in R.

- [Statquest](https://statquest.org/video-index/) is a wonderful set of youtube videos going over many fundamental concepts.

## Alternative primary resources
The books below have slightly different focuses but would also be a good starting place and going through any of them would provide a good perch to move forward. In particular both stress the kinds of data (like genomics data) that many "modern" biologists are dealing with now, which is a good thing. I particularly like the Irizarry and Love approach.

[Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/) *Holmes & Huber*

[Data Analysis for the Life Sciences](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences/)
 *Irizarry and Love*
 
 [The Foundations of Statistics: A Simulation Based Approach](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-16313-5)
*Vasishth & Broe*
- different pedagogical approach that builds intuition and understanding about inferential methods via simulation. 

## Other Statistics resources that were mentioned as starting places

Cartoon Guide to Statistics by Gonick & Smith

[Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists](https://www2.ib.unicamp.br/profs/fsantos/apostilas/Quinn%20&%20Keough.pdf)
by Quinn & Keough. Similar approach to Gotelli and Ellison.

Nonparametric Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences - Siegel & Castellan

The Geometry of Multivariate Statistics by TD Wickens
- nice geometric representations of simple statistics (like correlations, linear regression). Useful if you are planning on moving onto multivariate statistics after.
	
[Introduction to Bayesian Statistics, Third Edition](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118593165)
Bolstad & Curran
- Nice introduction to statistics, from a Bayesian perspective. 

## After you level up

Once you have gone through one or more of the books above, and you want to take things to the next level, here are a just a few suggestions.


Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models by Gelman & Hill
- 	Ian taught jointly using this and Bolker (see below), and it is a great introduction to practical approaches to using general and generalized linear models, and mixed models.
-	Intermediate level book recommended AFTER taking the Intro Grad Stats course
-	Introduces Bayesian stastistics
-	geared towards social science examples, but very readable.


Regression Modeling Strategies: With Applications to Linear Models, Logistic Regression, and Survival Analysis (Springer Series in Statistics)
Frank Harrell
-	practical, rigourous, 
-	linear regression, survival analysis


Various Titles 
	AF Zuur
http://www.highstat.com
-	good for complex ecological problems
-	modeling approach
-	but not as rigourous as Ben would like 
-	has about 15 books out


Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits
Lynch & Walsh
https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/genetics-and-analysis-of-quantitative-traits-9780878934812?cc=ca&lang=en&
- Ian Loves this book, but it is quite specialized, and even he does not recommend it as a general purpose book for advanced linear models.




Doing Bayesian Data Analysis
	John K. Kruschke
https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/what-s-new-in-2nd-ed
Approaches to Statistical Inference

Michael McCarthy
-	has some issues with other inferential approaches other than Bayesian

Little Red Books (Ben suggested these but I couldn't find anything online)


Introduction to Biostatistics 2nd Edition
	Sokal & Rohlf
http://www.evolbiol.ru/docs/docs/large_files/biostatistics.pdf
-	teaches an older less general approach to inference

Recommended YouTube Videos
-	start with videos on Probability Theory

DataCamp has good quality, hands-on, courses: https://www.datacamp.com/
•	It’s _not_ a free option but someone who is motivated about learning R can subscribe for one month for about $40 and learn a ton during that month. The free option lets you access 9 courses, which is good to check if you like the course format.
