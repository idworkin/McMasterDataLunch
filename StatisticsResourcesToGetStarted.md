# Statistics resources to get started.

This is based on a discussion led by Susan Marsh-Rollo (Nov 23rd 2018) about how to get ready for taking a class like Bio708, or just get yourself started with learning statistics from a few different perspectives.


## Primary resources

### A good pairing (R skills but fundamentals).
A Primer of Ecological Statistics
	NJ Gotelli & AE Ellison
- focused on introducing the basic conceptual side, experimental design, inference. Platform agnostic. Very clear. Not a heavy focus on effect size and inferences about them (too bad).

 [Introductory Statistics with R](http://www.academia.dk/BiologiskAntropologi/Epidemiologi/PDF/Introductory_Statistics_with_R__2nd_ed.pdf)
	Peter Dalgaard
- this represents the Rish practical side and the mechanics of analysis and inference in R.
