## Libraries
```{r}
library(predictmeans)
library(emmeans)
library(ggplot2)
```


## Data set 


![Iris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Irissetosa1.jpg)



```{r}
data(iris)
```


## Some summaries

```{r}
head(iris)

with(iris, table(Species))
```


## quick plot


```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(y = Sepal.Length, x = Petal.Length, col = Species)) +
   geom_point()
```



## Let's consider a situation

 (this is made up!)
 
 While we want to compare the differences between species for these morphological traits, we are specifically interested in in comparisons of versicolor to the other two species. So how may we do this
 
 
## What if we just fit a linear model (simple one way ANOVA)?
```{r}
mod1 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species,
           data = iris)

anova(mod1)
summary(mod1)
```

By default this is showing us the differences of both *versicolor* and *virginica* to *setosa*.  So the intercept is the mean length of Sepals for *setosa*, and the other two coefficients are the treatment contrasts (differences) for the other two species with *setosa*.


## A couple of ways of thinking about this that may help

```{r}
SL_means_Species <- with(iris, 
     tapply(Sepal.Length, Species, mean))

SL_means_Species
```


As this is such a simple model (just a single factor) these means will be the same as the predicted values from the models

```{r}
species_predictedVals <- unique(predict(mod1))

names(species_predictedVals) <- c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica")

species_predictedVals 
```


Or the differences
```{r}
SL_means_Species["versicolor"] - SL_means_Species["setosa"]

SL_means_Species["virginica"] - SL_means_Species["setosa"]

```


## This is not the difference(s) we are looking for

But we are not interested in the difference between setosa and the other two species, but in comparisons to versicolor.


## Reminding ourselves of the "design matrix"


One easy fix for this without having to think about custom contrasts at all (yet!) is to re-level our factor so that the base level is versicolor


```{r}
iris$Species2 <- relevel(iris$Species, "versicolor")
```


Now if we fit the same model

```{r}
mod1_alt <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species2,
           data = iris)

summary(mod1_alt)
```



Why did this work? Because we re-organized the design matrix a bit.  


Our initial design matrix had this format
```{r}
unique(model.matrix(mod1))
```


When we changed the reference level, the intercept was now *versicolor* instead of *setosa*. 

```{r}
unique(model.matrix(mod1_alt))
```


## So what's the problem

This solution is ok for this really simple problem, but it is not particularly useful for more complex models, or complex contrasts.

What if I wanted to compare the difference between versicolor and the other two species? How should I go about doing that?



```{r}
species_predictedVals
```

One way of thinking about this is comparing the predicted value of setosa to the mean of the predicted values of the other two species


```{r}
species_predictedVals["versicolor"] - mean(species_predictedVals[c("setosa", "virginica")])
```

Another way of writing this out is thinking about it like this


```{r}
1*species_predictedVals["versicolor"] - (1/2)*species_predictedVals["setosa"] - (1/2)*species_predictedVals["virginica"] 
```


That is, the difference between the predicted value of versicolor and half the predicted value of each of the other two species.


```{r}
contrast_vector_example <- c(1, -0.5, -0.5)

sum(contrast_vector_example)
```

This is the same as saying if the predicted value of setosa was the same as the mean of the predicted values of the other two species, the difference should be zero. 

This is an example of a custom contrast. Our $(1, -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2})$ represents the contrasts coefficients.

## Contrast coefficients
We can contstruct our contrast coefficients with a few basic "rules" (See Crawley pg 368-369)

- Treatments to be lumped together (like setosa and virginica) get the same sign ($+$ or $-$)
- Groups of means to be contrasted get opposite signs.
- a contrast coefficient of $0$ is used if that factor level wants to excluded.
- The sum of the contrasts coefficients add up to zero.

## Ok, great?

Well a couple of issues. First the way I just wrote this, is annoying for anything but a toy problem like this. 
More importantly I want to be able to assess the uncertainty in this difference I computed. That means some fiddly algebra with the standard errors for each estimate.  


## custom contrasts in base R.
Not shockingly in base R, we can use the `contrasts` function to help set up our custom contrasts

We can see what the default contrasts are


```{r}
contrasts(iris$Species)


contrasts(iris$Species2)
```

Say in addition to the contrast above, I planned to also contrast the difference between setosa and virginica. how could we set this up?


```{r}
levels(iris$Species2)

VvS <- c(0, 1, -1)  # setosa VS viginica


contrast_vector_species <- c(-0.5, 1, -0.5)
#contrasts(iris$Species2) <- cbind(VvS, contrast_vector_species2)

contrasts(iris$Species2)

```



## using emmeans

While you can write out custom contrasts, I find it really a pain in the but, so use emmeans!


```{r}
summary(mod1)


spp_em <- emmeans(mod1, ~ Species)   # means
spp_em 


contrast(spp_em, 
         list(vers_VS_other = contrast_vector_species, VvS = c(1, 0, -1)))

```


This approach allows much more flexibility


see `?contrast-methods`
```{r}
pairs(spp_em)

confint(pairs(spp_em))
```


and we could have gotten our setosa VS virginica (i.e. excluding versicolor) comparison this way
```{r}
pairs(spp_em, exclude = 2)
```
