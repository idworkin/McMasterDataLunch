# Introduction to contrasts, and using emmeans

## Libraries
```{r, results='hide'}
library(lme4)
library(emmeans)
library(car)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggbeeswarm)
```

## First example  with the iris data set


![Iris](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Irissetosa1.jpg)


```{r}
data(iris)
```


### The iris data

```{r}
head(iris)

with(iris, table(Species))
```


### quick plot of the iris data


```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(y = Sepal.Length, x = Petal.Length, col = Species)) +
   geom_point()
```


### Let's consider a situation

 (this "question" is made up to facilitate the analysis!)
 
 While we want to compare the differences between species for these morphological traits, we are specifically interested in in comparisons of *versicolor* to the other two species. So how may we do this?
 
 
### What if we just fit a linear model (simple one way ANOVA)?
```{r}
mod1 <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species,
           data = iris)

anova(mod1)
summary(mod1)
```

By default this shows the differences of each of *versicolor* and *virginica* to *setosa*. The intercept is the mean Sepal length for *setosa*, and the other two coefficients are the treatment contrasts (differences) for the other two species with *setosa*.


### A couple of ways of thinking about this that may help

Compute the species means
```{r}
SL_means_Species <- with(iris, 
     tapply(Sepal.Length, Species, mean))

SL_means_Species
```


As this is such a simple model (just a single factor) these means will be the same as the predicted values from the models:

```{r}
species_predictedVals <- unique(predict(mod1))

names(species_predictedVals) <- c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica")

species_predictedVals 
```


and the differences between the means can be estimated simply:
```{r}
SL_means_Species["versicolor"] - SL_means_Species["setosa"]

SL_means_Species["virginica"] - SL_means_Species["setosa"]
```


### These are not the difference(s) we are looking for


![droids](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2JJKs3I69qfaQleE/giphy.gif)



But we are not interested in the difference between setosa and the other two species, but in comparisons to versicolor.


## Reviewing (or introducing) ourselves to the "design matrix"


One easy fix for this without having to think about custom contrasts at all (yet!) is to re-level our factor so that the base level is versicolor:


```{r}
iris$Species2 <- relevel(iris$Species, "versicolor")
```


Now if we fit the same model, just with *versicolor* representing the intercept

```{r}
mod1_alt <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species2,
           data = iris)

summary(mod1_alt)
```



Why did this work? Because we re-organized the design matrix a bit.  


Our initial design matrix had this format
```{r}
unique(model.matrix(mod1))
```


When we changed the reference level, the intercept was now *versicolor* instead of *setosa*. 

```{r}
unique(model.matrix(mod1_alt))
```


## So what's the problem?

This solution is OK for this really really simple case. It is not particularly useful for more complex models, or complex contrasts.

What if I wanted to compare the difference between *versicolor* and the other two species? How should I go about doing that?

Here are the predicted values again:
```{r}
species_predictedVals
```

One way of thinking about this is comparing the predicted value of *setosa* to the mean of the predicted values of the other two species


```{r}
species_predictedVals["versicolor"] - mean(species_predictedVals[c("setosa", "virginica")])
```


Mathematically,

$$ 1 \times \hat{\mu}_{versicolor}  - \frac{1}{2} \times\hat{\mu}_{setosa} - \frac{1}{2} \times\hat{\mu}_{virginica}$$

i.e

$$ 1 \times \hat{\mu}_{versicolor}  - \frac{1}{2} (\hat{\mu}_{setosa} + \hat{\mu}_{virginica})$$

with coefficients

$$ (1,- \frac{1}{2}, - \frac{1}{2} )$$

```{r}
1*species_predictedVals["versicolor"] - (1/2)*species_predictedVals["setosa"] - (1/2)*species_predictedVals["virginica"] 
```


That is, the difference between the predicted value of versicolor and half the predicted value of each of the other two species.


```{r}
contrast_vector_example <- c(1, -0.5, -0.5)

sum(contrast_vector_example)
```

This is the same as saying if the predicted value of *setosa* was the same as the mean of the predicted values of the other two species, the difference should be zero. 


$$ \hat{\mu}_{versicolor}  \approxeq \frac{1}{2} (\hat{\mu}_{setosa} + \hat{\mu}_{virginica})$$

This is an example of a custom contrast. Our $(1, -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2})$ represents the contrasts coefficients.

### Contrast coefficients

We can construct our contrast coefficients with a few basic "rules" (See Crawley pg 368-369)

- Treatments to be lumped together (like setosa and virginica) get the same sign ($+$ or $-$)
- Groups of means to be contrasted get opposite signs
- a contrast coefficient of $0$ is used if that factor level is to be excluded from the comparison
- The sum of the contrasts coefficients add up to zero

### OK, great?

Well a couple of issues. First the way I just wrote this, is annoying for anything but a toy problem like this. 
More importantly I want to be able to assess the uncertainty in this difference I computed. That means some fiddly algebra with the standard errors for each estimate.   


### custom contrasts in base R.
Not shockingly in base R, we can use the `contrasts` function to help set up our custom contrasts

We can see what the default contrasts are


```{r}
contrasts(iris$Species)

contrasts(iris$Species2)
```

Say in addition to the contrast above, I planned to also contrast the difference between *setosa* and *virginica*. How could we set this up?

```{r}
levels(iris$Species)

setosa_virginica <- c(1, 0, -1)  # setosa VS virginica


versicolor_VS_others <- c(-0.5, 1, -0.5)
```

Unfortunately using these effectively with base R requires a few additional algebraic steps, which we want to avoid for now. So let's use emmeans which can take care of all of this for us.

## using emmeans

While you can write out custom contrasts, I find it really a pain in the but, so use emmeans!


### Getting the estimated means and their confidence intervals with emmeans
```{r}
summary(mod1)

spp_em <- emmeans(mod1, ~Species)   # means
spp_em 

plot(spp_em) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```


### Setting up our custom contrasts in emmeans
We can use the `contrast` function (note, not `contrasts` with an **s** at the end) and provide these to get the contrasts we are interested in.
```{r}
iris_custom_contrasts <- contrast(spp_em, 
         list(versicolor_VS_others = versicolor_VS_others, 
              virginica_VS_setosa = c(1, 0, -1)))

iris_custom_contrasts
```


Even more useful we can also get the confidence intervals on the contrasts!
```{r}
confint(iris_custom_contrasts )
```


Which can be plotted easily (ggplot2 object)

```{r}
plot(iris_custom_contrasts) +
         geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2 , alpha = 0.5) +
         theme_bw() +
         theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
         
```


### Flexibility with emmeans for many types of contrasts
This approach allows much more flexibility. see `?contrast-methods`

Importantly and helpfully, for broader sets of contrasts emmeans does much automatically

If we had *a priori* (really important!), planned to compare all species to each other we could use this

```{r}
contrast(spp_em, method = "pairwise")

pairs(spp_em) # same as above, just a shortcut function.

confint(pairs(spp_em))
```

Note how it automatically adjusts for the multiple comparisons in this case!

```{r}
plot(pairs(spp_em)) +
         geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2 , alpha = 0.5) +
         xlab("Estimated difference in Sepal Lengths")
```

and, usefully we could have gotten our setosa VS virginica (i.e. excluding versicolor) comparison this way
```{r}
pairs(spp_em, exclude = 2)
```


## An example of interaction contrasts from a linear mixed effects model

Here is an example from a much more complex linear mixed model.

The data is from an artificial selection experiment in *Drosophila melanogaster*, where, over the course of more than 350 generations (when this data was generated) flies were selected sex concordantly or discordantly for body size.

We have been investigating trait specific changes in sexual size dimorphism, and how it compares to what is observed in the control lineages (where the ancestral pattern of female biased size dimorphism occurs). So we are interested in particular in the effects of the interaction between sex and selective treatment. How best to examine this?

A subset of the data from this experiment is available in the same github repository as "contrast_tutorial_dat.RData"

### The data
```{r}
load("./contrast_tutorial_dat.RData")

size_dat <- contrast_tutorial_dat
```


What the data frame looks like
```{r}
head(size_dat)
```

### A quick visual summary

```{r}
ggplot(size_dat, 
       aes( y = length, x = selection:sex, col = sex, shape = replicate)) +
  geom_quasirandom(alpha = 0.8, size = 1.4) +
  labs( y = "length (mm)") +
  ggtitle("thorax") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 18))
```


Here is the  model we used for the study for this trait. I will briefly discuss it with you, but importantly you will see it is more complicated than our toy example above.

### review: Why log transform the response variable?
**Note:** with the model that I am multiplying thorax length by 1000 (to convert to $\mu m$) and then using a $log_2$ transformation on it.

Why am I doing the log transformation in the first place?

I am doing the transformation directly in the model call itself. This is not necessary, but emmeans will recognize this, and facilitates backtransformation of our estimates.


### The model
```{r}
mod1_thorax <- lmer(log2(length*1000) ~ (sex + selection + sampling)^2 + (0 + sex| replicate:selection),
           data = size_dat, 
           subset = repeat_measure == "1")
```


### Limited value of ANOVAs for interaction effect
So how do we make sense of how sexual size dimorphism is changing among the selective treatments?

An Anova (putting aside limitations on ANOVA in general, and for mixed models in particular for the moment) is not particularly informative

```{r}
Anova(mod1_thorax)
```

We see a significant effect of the interaction between sex and sampling, but so what? What selective treatment is this a result of and what are the magnitudes of the change? An Anova is not useful for this.


### The model coefficients (in standard treatment contrast form) are not super helpful either

For a model this complicated we also see that the summary table of coefficients is not simple to parse for our needs (we could do lots of adding up of various terms, but how about the standard errors for these...)


```{r}
summary(mod1_thorax)
```



### Using emmeans for this model
This is where contrasts become SO useful!

#### Estimated marginal means 
First, just the estimated means, for each sex, by selective regime
```{r}
thorax_emm <- emmeans(mod1_thorax, specs = ~ sex | selection)

thorax_emm

plot(thorax_emm,
     xlab = "model estimates, thorax length, log2 microM") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```


#### side note: Backtransforming in emmeans
Like I mentioned emmeans can recognize the log2 transformation, so if you prefer the measures or plots in $\mu m$ response scale.

```{r}
thorax_emm_response <- emmeans(mod1_thorax, specs = ~ sex | selection, type = "response")

thorax_emm_response

plot(thorax_emm_response,
     xlab = "model estimates, thorax length, microM") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```


### contrasts for sexual dimorphism
 While it is not the hypothesis we are examining, for purposes of clarity of taking you through the steps, let's examine treatment specific patterns of sexual dimorphism. We will set this up as so:


```{r}
thorax_vals <- emmeans(mod1_thorax, 
             specs = ~ sex | selection)

SSD_contrasts_treatment <- pairs(thorax_vals)

SSD_contrasts_treatment

confint(SSD_contrasts_treatment)
```


```{r}
plot(SSD_contrasts_treatment) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2, alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(x = "sexual size dimorphism") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```


### The interaction contrast
But what we really want is to see how dimorphism changes in the selected treatments, relative to the controls. This is the interaction contrast (contrast of contrasts)

```{r}
thorax_ssd <- emmeans(mod1_thorax,  pairwise ~ sex*selection) # warning is letting you know these are not of general use. We only do this as we are forming an interaction contrast.

thorax_ssd_contrasts <- contrast(thorax_ssd[[1]], 
                                 interaction = c(selection = "trt.vs.ctrl1", sex = "pairwise"),
                                 by = NULL)


thorax_ssd_contrasts

confint(thorax_ssd_contrasts)

plot(thorax_ssd_contrasts) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2, alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(x = "change in SSD relative to control lineages", y = "comparison") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```
