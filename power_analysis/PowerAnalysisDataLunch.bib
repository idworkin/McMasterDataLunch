  abstract = {An important step when designing an empirical study is to justify the sample size that will be collected. The key aim of a sample size justification for such studies is to explain how the collected data is expected to provide valuable information given the inferential goals of the researcher. In this overview article six approaches are discussed to justify the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: (1) collecting data from (almost) the entire population, (2) choosing a sample size based on resource constraints, (3) performing an a-priori power analysis, (4) planning for a desired accuracy, (5) using heuristics, or (6) explicitly acknowledging the absence of a justification. An important question to consider when justifying sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed interesting, and the extent to which the data that is collected informs inferences about these effect sizes. Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider (1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, (2) which minimal effect size will be statistically significant, (3) which effect sizes they expect (and what they base these expectations on), (4) which effect sizes would be rejected based on a confidence interval around the effect size, (5) which ranges of effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power analysis, and (6) which effect sizes are expected in a specific research area. Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article, for example by using the interactive form in the accompanying online Shiny app, to improve their sample size justification, and hopefully, align the informational value of a study with their inferential goals.

  abstract = {Power analysis and sample-size determination are related tools that have recently gained popularity in the environmental sciences. Their indiscriminate application, however, can lead to wildly misleading results. This is particularly true in environmental monitoring and assessment, where the quality and nature of data is such that the implicit assumptions underpinning power and sample-size calculations are difficult to justify. When the assumptions are reasonably met these statistical techniques provide researchers with an important capability for the allocation of scarce and expensive resources to detect putative impact or change. Conventional analyses are predicated on a general linear model and normal distribution theory with statistical tests of environmental impact couched in terms of changes in a population mean. While these are `optimal' statistical tests (uniformly most powerful), they nevertheless pose considerable practical difficulties for the researcher. Compounding this difficulty is the subsequent analysis of the data and the impost of a decision framework that commences with an assumption of `no effect'. This assumption is only discarded when the sample data indicate demonstrable evidence to the contrary. The alternative (`green') view is that any anthropogenic activity has an impact on the environment and therefore a more realistic initial position is to assume that the environment is already impacted. In this article we examine these issues and provide a re-formulation of conventional mean-based hypotheses in terms of population percentiles. Prior information or belief concerning the probability of exceeding a criterion is incorporated into the power analysis using a Bayesian approach. Finally, a new statistic is introduced which attempts to balance the overall power regardless of the decision framework adopted. Copyright {\copyright} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
