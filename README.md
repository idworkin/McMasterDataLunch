# McMasterDataLunch

This repository is associated with McMaster DataLunch series organized by  B. Bolker. 
This is just a place to put links to papers and libraries that we discuss in DataLunch to make it easier for all to find things.

We did for one DataLunch discuss and create a general [resource page here](https://github.com/idworkin/McMasterDataLunch/blob/master/StatisticsResourcesToGetStarted.md)

For the week to week bits, if you are adding to it, please do add the *date* and initials of presenter (so we can more easily find things). If this gets unwieldy we can do something different in the future.

Just go to the [assortedSundryLinks](https://github.com/idworkin/McMasterDataLunch/blob/master/AssortedSundryLinks.md)
