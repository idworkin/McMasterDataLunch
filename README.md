# McMasterDataLunch

This repository is associated with McMaster DataLunch series organized by  B. Bolker. 
This is just a place to put links to papers and libraries that we discuss in DataLunch to make it easier for all to find things.

If you are adding to it, please do add the *date* and last name of the presenter (so we can more easily find things). If this gets unwieldy we can do something different in the future.

Just go to the [assortedSundryLinks](https://github.com/idworkin/McMasterDataLunch/blob/master/AssortedSundryLinks.md)
